      The Acoustic-Phonetic and Spontaneous Speech Corpus of IRST
                            (APASCI)

  The   acoustic-phonetic  continuous  speech  part of  APASCI  contains
  Italian read  utterances and was  conceived  for  the  development and
  evaluation of automatic  speech recognition  systems.  It was designed
  with the purpose of collecting speech  material as  phonetically  rich
  as possible. Furthermore,  the database  allows  the   acquisition  of
  acoustic-phonetic knowledge of the Italian language.
